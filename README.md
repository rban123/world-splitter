- put 'universe a/b' as placeholder
- add button to generate random inputs (e.g. do the dishes!)
- what will get your app far is polish . an app with polish is more likely to be shared . this could be an app in which you put a lot of design polish
- make background go back and forth
- be able to press back to go to splash page
- link to bottom that says explanation
- cite now-mainstream
- add links and such to about page
- store splash state in localStorage
